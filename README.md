Content in Japanese (日本語コンテンツ)

日本語のReadmeは[こちら](README_jp.md)．

## Target Audience

- Pre-university students interested in STEM
- Non-engineering/science university students

In either case, experience in MATLAB&reg; is not needed.

## Goals of the workshop

This workshop is intended to demonstrate the importance of data analysis to young students. By having students perform data analysis on real-world problems, they will experience

- what it means to do data analysis
- how data analysis helps them understand the world around them
- the process of problem solving through logical thinking and verification

## Format

The content can be used in two different formats.

- 3-hour workshop with facilitation
- Self-paced learning

The overall structure is for students to go through the content on their own, at their own pace. When held as a workshop, the facilitator can check in with the students to see the progress and discuss the results. There are multiple "Observation" points within the workshop, and those are good places to hold open discussions.
